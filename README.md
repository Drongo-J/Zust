Sure, here's the updated README for Zust Social Media App:

# Zust Social Media App - Getting Started Guide

Welcome to Zust Social Media App! This guide will help you get started with setting up and running the application using Visual Studio 2022. The app utilizes Entity Framework Code First approach and requires a SQL database with the necessary data. Before you proceed, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

1. Visual Studio 2022 (or a compatible version).
2. SQL Server (Express Edition or higher) or SQL Server LocalDB.

## Clone the Repository

To get started, first, you need to clone the GitHub repository to your local machine. You can do this by following these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Change the current working directory to the location where you want to clone the repository.
3. Execute the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Drongo-J/Zust
```

## Set Up the Database

Next, we'll set up the SQL database for Zust Social Media App using Entity Framework Code First. Follow these steps to create the database and apply the initial migrations:

1. Open Visual Studio 2022.
2. Open the solution file (`Zust.sln`).
3. In the Solution Explorer, locate the `Zust.Web` project and make sure it's set as the startup project (right-click on the project and select "Set as Startup Project").
4. Open the Package Manager Console (PMC) from the Visual Studio menu: Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console.
5. In the PMC, make sure that the "Default Project" selected is `Zust.Web`.
6. Run the following command to create a new migration:

```bash
Add-Migration InitialCreate
```

This command will generate a migration file based on the changes in the model classes.

7. After creating the migration, run the following command to apply the initial migrations and create the database:

```bash
Update-Database
```

The `Update-Database` command will create the database and set up the required tables based on the defined model classes.

Please note that `Add-Migration` needs to be run whenever you make changes to the model classes or database schema in the future. It generates new migrations to capture those changes, and you need to run `Update-Database` again to apply those changes to the database.

## Insert Initial Data

Now that the database is set up with the required tables, you need to insert the initial data into the database. Zust Social Media App provides SQL scripts to insert the initial data. Follow these steps to insert the data:

1. In the Solution Explorer, navigate to the `Database` folder.
2. You will find the following SQL script files:
   - `CommentSqlStatements.sql`
   - `FriendRequestSqlStatements.sql`
   - `FriendshipSqlStatements.sql`
   - `LikeSqlStatements.sql`
   - `NotificationSqlStatements.sql`
   - `PostSqlStatements.sql`
   - `UserSqlStatements.sql`
3. Open each `.sql` file and execute the SQL statements in your SQL client (e.g., SQL Server Management Studio). Running these scripts will insert the initial data into the respective tables.

Please ensure that you execute the scripts in the correct order, as some tables may have dependencies on others.

## Insert Initial Data

Now that the database is set up with the required tables, you need to insert the initial data into the database. Zust Social Media App provides SQL scripts to insert the initial data. Follow these steps to insert the data:

1. In the Solution Explorer, navigate to the `Database` folder.
2. You will find script files. Execute the SQL scripts in the following order:

   - `UserSqlStatements.sql`
   - `PostSqlStatements.sql`
   - `CommentSqlStatements.sql`
   - `LikeSqlStatements.sql`
   - `FriendRequestSqlStatements.sql`
   - `FriendshipSqlStatements.sql`
   - `NotificationSqlStatements.sql`

Running these scripts in the specified order will insert the initial data into the respective tables.

Please ensure that you execute the scripts in the correct order, as some tables may have dependencies on others.

## Set Connection String

The connection string is read from the `appsettings.json` file. Follow these steps to update the connection string:

1. Open the solution file (`Zust.sln`) using Visual Studio 2022.
2. Locate the `appsettings.json` file under the `Zust.Web` project.
3. In the `appsettings.json` file, find the `"ConnectionStrings"` section.
4. Replace the value of the `Default` key with your SQL Server connection string.

Example connection string:

```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "Default": "Data Source=(localdb)\\MSSQLLocalDB;Initial Catalog=YourDatabaseName;Integrated Security=True;Connect Timeout=30;Encrypt=False;Trust Server Certificate=False;Application Intent=ReadWrite;Multi Subnet Failover=False"
},
```

Please ensure that your connection string points to the correct SQL Server instance and database name.

## Run the Application

Now that the database is set up, and the connection string is configured, you can run the application using Visual Studio 2022. Follow these steps:

1. Open the solution file (`Zust.sln`) in Visual Studio 2022.
2. Set the `Zust.Web` project as the startup project (right-click on the project in the Solution Explorer and select "Set as Startup Project").
3. Press F5 or click the "Start" button in Visual Studio to run the application.

The application will build, and a new browser window will open with Zust Social Media App up and running.
